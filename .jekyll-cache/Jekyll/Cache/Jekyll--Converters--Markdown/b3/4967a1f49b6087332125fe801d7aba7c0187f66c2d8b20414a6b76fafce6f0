I"<p>This is, simply, a home for thoughts. It has always been a goal of mine to document my writing process and the first year of university seemed to be a natural starting point. I have never been a prolific writer, but I see the value in documenting these loose images and snapshots of time - each a paint stroke, each an impression.</p>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Sophia Li is a student at Yale University looking to double major in English and Molecular Biology. Native to New York City, she finds comfort in the business, characteristic of a “New Yorker,” and the briskness the aged brick buildings command. When free, she can be found rereading Kafka on the Shore, learning how to watercolor, or diligently watering her only succulent.</p>
