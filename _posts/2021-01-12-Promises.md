I think about the cool, cool sand and that beach we were not allowed to enter. The bridge, brown and broken, and our bare feet dancing atop the splintering wood. Isn’t it strange we were never punctured? It was almost as if we were always afloat, lifted by our intertwined hands as we leapt, higher and higher in the afternoon sun. You gave me a seashell, smooth and white. Its sides tapered and dotted with gray flecks. You pressed it into my hands — a token and I vowed never to lose it. I do not remember the water and I do not remember your eyes. But I know that both pulled at me as the waves receded and I, the fool, let myself drift further and further — the bridge belonging to the beach and me belonging to the sea. 

I must have loved you very much then, to not remember the drowning that my mother recalls was the scariest moment of her life, but to remember the feeling of your pudgy fingers. The phantom flesh imprinted on my own, sticky with sweet. I never saw you again. You were gone with the tide — and not even the moon could bring you back. When I awoke, hair wet and mouth salty, in my hand was no seashell but a broken bottle cap. One promise exchanged for another.
