Sometimes, all skin can be — is a prison.
I reach for a trail of stars, too far. Gone.

The forgotten trails of a love long gone,
My mother hated the sound of my voice

I hated the sounds of my mother.
Narcissus looked through one-way mirrors,

Echo — the shadow behind one-way mirrors.
My hope can never stop giving up. 

The hopeful never stop giving. Up-
stairs, my father holds onto his grief, close.

I stare at my father, too small to be close,
My body was soft enough to scar.

Their bodies cut deep enough to scar.
Sometimes, all skin can be — is a prison.
